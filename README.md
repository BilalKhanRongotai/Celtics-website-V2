`# Welcome to my Boston Celtics Sample Page

### My dev team

### My website background
I created a website that relates to my favourite basketball team the Boston Celtics. Another note about my screenshots is I was unable to et the entire screen or webpage as it was bigger than my display monitor sorry for that inconvienece. For my entire website I used css grid and html, I thought about using Java script but didn't know how to incorporate it into my website. I looked at a bunch of Boston Celtics websites and some fan made ones to get a idea of the theme.
### Layout
This is my homepage the hero image is actually a slideshow and has a few photos on it. The background is a picture of the Boston Celtics Homecourt in the TD Garden. I have chosen the colors I chose because they are the team colors. I had a problem with the slideshow animation with resizing and moving. I decide to put all my information e.g maori page link on the same grid part (grid main) because I thought on the main page everything sshould be accesible easily. For the Social media links and my name in grid footer I set the back ground as the teams former logos. You cannot see it on this screenshiot but you can see it in the other screen shots where I was able to get the full screenshot.

 This is my Image Gallery it consists of players past and present. I used css grid and flexbox to do it. I was going to let the images zoom on hover but that didn't work because of the css grid.

This is my Video page  I only decided to put one video as putting multiple would limit the users attention, I decided to put the current teams best plays of the season as I thought this would describe them perfectly. I also have the controls such as pause and
