`# Welcome to my Boston Celtics Sample Page

### My dev team
- Bilal Khan
### My website background
I created a website that relates to my favourite basketball team the Boston Celtics. Another note about my screenshots is I was unable to et the entire screen or webpage as it was bigger than my display monitor sorry for that inconvienece. For my entire website I used css grid and html, I thought about using Java script but didn't know how to incorporate it into my website. I looked at a bunch of Boston Celtics websites and some fan made ones to get a idea of the theme. My website is supposed to be intended towards fans of the Boston Celtics and anyone else wanting to learn about the Boston Celtics.
### Layout
This is my homepage the hero image is actually a slideshow and has a few photos on it. The background is a picture of the Boston Celtics Homecourt in the TD Garden. I have chosen the colors I chose because they are the team colors. I had a problem with the slideshow animation with resizing and moving. I decide to put all my information e.g maori page link on the same grid part (grid main) because I thought on the main page everything sshould be accesible easily. For the Social media links and my name in grid footer I set the back ground as the teams former logos. You cannot see it on this screenshiot but you can see it in the other screen shots where I was able to get the full screenshot. I decide to make my menu at the top of the grid main and put the logo on it on the left and when you hover over it goes to the right and changes color I did this because I think it looks nice and most websites I took inspiration from did this.

 This is my Image Gallery it consists of players past and present. I used css grid and flexbox to do it. I was going to let the images zoom on hover but that didn't work because of the css grid limits. I put a silver framing around the images to make it feel like they are framed.

This is my Video page  I only decided to put one video as putting multiple would limit the users attention, I decided to put the current teams best plays of the season as I thought this would describe them perfectly. I also have the controls such as pause and unmute.

 This is my Players page
   Both the images when clicked on take you to a website about them and their stats. I chose to do this because my target demographic which are fans might be intrested in players stats and other facts. I chose a simple image which shows the starting five. I had a plan to put in every player but that be diffuclt as teams smaller players move around quite alot. 1 problem I had with this is that the images since they are hyperlinks have bulletpoints on them I tried several times to get rid of it by doing things such as list style none but it didn't seem to make  a difference.

 This is my History page
 For the history page I wrote a brief description of the Boston Celtics from the start till noww. I also added a few photos of players uniforms and logos/badges. I used the same design as other pages, using flexbox to postion the images.

 This is my Contact page
 On the contact page all the images arre clickable and take you to the indicative social media page. I decide to make the gridmain menu transparrent as I thought it would be nice to look at the backgtround which is a player dunking. I had problems with the bulletpoints again and putting the google map there as it wasn't zoomed in enough and it is hard to put a definitive position on where the cletics are so I put the arena they play in.
